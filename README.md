### how to use 
* First, open the 'install_go' folder.
* Two variables are needed for this: one is the version number we want to download, and the other is the path where we want to install it on our local machine.
* Such as `sh install_go.sh -v go1.22.3 -p /Users/carpewang/Desktop`
* Finally, if it displays **Go $version has been installed successfully!**, then the installation is successful. 
* You can check if it's installed successfully by entering `go version`.
